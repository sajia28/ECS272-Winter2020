As was claimed in our proposal, we completed the UI interface, dataset, and masking script by March 2nd.


Dataset

We manually created a dataset with 6 features and 600 data samples. Each data sample represents a used item that is being sold on Amazon. The 6 features are the used item’s category, general name, technical name that is listed on Amazon, offered price, weight, paid disposal options, and free disposal methods. An item belongs to one of 3 categories: electronics, sports equipment, or furniture. Each category possesses 10 unique items. An item is considered unique when it has a unique general name. Each unique item has 20 data samples associated with it. In other words, 20 data samples have the same general name for each general name. This means that each category has 200 data samples. 

Every feature except for the paid and free disposal options was extracted from listings in Amazon. Information on paid and free disposal options was gathered from various other websites. Each disposal options entry is a comma separated list of disposal options that is sorted in descending order of recommendation. In other words, the first list element is the disposal option that is most strongly recommended by us.  We recommend one disposal option over the other if it lets the user save more money or if it offers more convenience to the user. For example, we recommend curbside collection services over dumpster rentals when the item is generally small since curbside collection services are more inclined to accept small objects and the vast majority of people already pay for curbside collection. If a disposal option is not available to a specific item, then it is not included in the list. Note that we separate free disposal options from paid disposal options. This is because paid disposal options generally offer more convenience than free disposal options, but free disposal options allow the user to save or earn money. It is up to the user to determine which one bests suits them.
